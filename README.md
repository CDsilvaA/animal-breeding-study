# animal-breeding-study
Codes developed to assist in the understanding or manipulation of data related to animal breeding. Examples in the scripts.

## R-code: MAM_SA.R
Study of multiracial model presented in the discipline of Mating Systems by Prof. Dr. J. Augusto II having as source Prof. Dr. Mauricio Elzo material.

## Shell code: select_columns_genotype.sh
The code must be run in parts.  But it was developed by a challenge proposed by Dr. Gerardo Alves Fernandes JÃºnior in which from a user list it is possible to select markers of a genotype of study interest.

## R-code: hotspots.R
The R-code was developed to extract information from crossover events in the genome from the QMSim software output.

## Python code: extract_frequency_effect_allele.py
The Python code was developed to extract information from frequencies or effects of the alleles simulated by the QMSim software. It is necessary that the user has only the frequency data columns or effects in a file. To facilitate the selection of these columns in the original file, it is recommended to use the Visual Studio Code software.
